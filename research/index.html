<h4> Research Interests </h4>

	<p>My active research includes projects on (1) information costs and peer effects in school choice and (2) voter information and political polarization. </p> <br>
	
<h4> Working Papers </h4>
	
	<p>Joe Altonji, Rick Mansfield, and I have extended the Altonji-Mansfield model for selection on unobservables to: (1) Disaggregate location vs school effects after accounting for peer effects. 
	We show that under reasonable assumptions, our model provides an upper bound on peer effects (and thus a lower bound on school effects). 
	We find that for student outcomes, neighborhood effects are close to 0, but that school and commuting-zone effects are quite important.
(2) Test whether vertical school quality has a heterogeneous effect on student outcomes. We find no evidence for this type of heterogeneity. Draft of working paper is available upon request.</p>
