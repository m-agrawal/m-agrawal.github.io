	<b>Mohit Agrawal</b>, Joe Altonji, and Rick Mansfield. "Quantifying family, school, and location effects in the presence of complementarities and sorting." <i>Journal of Labor Economics</i> 37.S1 (2019): S11-S83.
	<p>In this work, Joe Altonji, Rick Mansfield, and I  extended the Altonji-Mansfield model for selection on unobservables to: <ol>
	<li> Disaggregate location vs school effects after accounting for peer effects. We show that under reasonable assumptions, our model provides an upper bound on peer effects (and thus a lower bound on school effects). We find that for student outcomes, neighborhood effects are close to 0, but that school and commuting-zone effects are quite important.</li>	
	<li> Test whether vertical school quality has a heterogeneous effect on student outcomes. We find no evidence for this type of heterogeneity. </li></ol></p>
