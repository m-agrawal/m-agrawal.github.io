<h4> Research Interests </h4>

	<p>My active research includes information costs and school choice, medical technology diffusion, and on political polarization. </p> <br>
	
<h4> Work-in-Progress </h4>
	
	<p>My current work-in-progress includes an extension of the Altonji-Mansfield model for selection on unobservables to separately identify the impact of neighborhood and school peer effects from direct school quality (joint with Altonji and Mansfield). Draft of working paper is available upon request.</p>
