<h4> Research Interests </h4>

	<p>My active research includes projects on (1) information costs and school choice, (2) medical technology diffusion, and (3) sources of political polarization. </p> <br>
	
<h4> Work-in-Progress </h4>
	
	<p>My current work-in-progress includes an extension of the Altonji-Mansfield model for selection on unobservables to separately identify the impact of location effects from school effects (joint with Altonji and Mansfield). Draft of working paper is available upon request.</p>
