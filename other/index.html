	<p>I served as deputy policy director and advisor to Gov. Ned Lamont from 2019-2021 and spearheaded a variety of public policy initiatives resulting in significant legislative and political achievements and measurable impacts on residents and economy. These initiatives include: (1) high-profile cannabis legalization effort resulting in clearing 270K criminal convictions and creating a new $73MM revenue source for state; (2) landmark reform of unemployment system that reduces taxes on 70% of businesses while maintaining benefit levels, improving solvency, and creating the country's highest-quality enhanced wage record; and (3) high-priority education/workforce legislation that improves access and equity in college admissions through the Connecticut Automatic Admissions Program and creates new pathways for entry into high-demand, high-paying occupations.
